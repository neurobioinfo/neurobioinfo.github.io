# The Neuro Bioinformatics Core Facility

The mission of the Neuro Bioinformatics Core Facility is to support and facilitate the best workflows and bioinformatics best practices to enable and empower the scientific community at the Neuro interested in computational biology and bioinformatics work. This will usually involve employing one of our existing workflows or inviting us to develop new ones.


To start working with us we ask that you first fill out our initial intake form which we will follow with a meeting allowing us to gather the necessary information so we can start on the work you want us to do with you.

 [INTAKE FORM](https://forms.clickup.com/f/c0qg2-87/ZA5RVAIEIX2YE3LHPV)
  

We are a [team](https://neurobioinfo.github.io/team) of dedicated and skilled bioinformatics people, ready to address any genomic and genetic analysis for 1 or 1,000 samples (or more). If you do not see the workflow that can address your bioinformatics needs, contact us at [neurobioinfo@mcgill.ca](mailto:neurobioinfo@mcgill.ca) and we will be happy to address your specific need(s).
