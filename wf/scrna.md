# Single Cell RNA-Seq Analysis


![scRNA-Seq](/wf/WF06_scRNASeq_workflow_ver01.jpg "scRNASeq Workflow")


## scRNA-Seq, gene product abundance and discovery.


### Short description of the workflow and its purpose:
This workflow takes as input miRNA sequence reads (presumably with Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMIs))  in FASTQ format and uses a number of tools to QC, trim, map, analyze, count and do a differential gene expression depending on your experimental design. All of these tools and workflow were extracted from the Potlaab and colleagues publication[2]. Other details on Bioinformatic Analysis of MicroRNA Sequencing Data are also described in the publication from Fu and Dong [3].



### Tools used in this workflow:
