# RNA-Seq and Differential Expression Analysis


![RNA-Seq and DEA](/wf/WF02_RNASeq_DEG_workflow_ver02.jpg "RNASeq DEA workflow")


## RNA-Seq, genes abundance and differential expression.

Understanding what transcriptome is present in a tissue or cell type is crucial to any functional genomic analysis, and many reviews on the topic of measuring RNA with next-generation sequencing technology abound [1]. 

Here is one protocol we have used at the Neuro: there are many others, and we encourage you to discuss alternatives with us.

### Short description of the workflow and its purpose:

* This workflow takes as input RNA sequence reads in FASTQ format and uses Salmon to perform a “pseudo-alignment.” Pseudo-alignment consists of mapping reads against a reference transcriptome index and quantifying the expression of transcripts. 
* Transcript quantification and variance estimation are generated by bootstraps sampling and modelling sample-specific parameters and biases using a Variational Bayesian EM algorithm [2].
* Salmon quantification files are used as input for Sleuth differential expression analysis (DEG). In order to test for differentially expressed genes, Sleuth models the true biological variance using a general linear model and the technical variance generated by bootstraps sampling from pseudo-alignments [3].
